Cause:Now I have a problem with my studies (I'm still studying) because of this I have no time for testing or creating new versions and lately I have a very bad headache I can't I can transfer this project to another person since everyone I know is not a programmer and does not know about phones, so I will probably have to close this project for 2 months, this version will be will be released in about a week and then the project will be closed for a month thanks to everyone who downloads this 
> The project will soon have its own name.
